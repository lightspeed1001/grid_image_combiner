# grid_image_combiner
Combines a set of images in a grid. Created for myself to make maps of La Mulana 2
Provided as-is and probably won't be improved much by me, since it has everything I need right now.

USAGE:
Start by setting the size of the grid (width & height) and hit apply. 
Then simply drag and drop image files to a tile. Double click to remove an image.
Once you're happy, you can export the image (default is png, can change in code).
You can also save the grid you have to a file and load later (in case you need to update something).

Quirks:
Settings do not save. Trim does nothing. Images get quite big.
